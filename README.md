# Automated_Tee_Time_Booking

This program allows you to book a tee time in an automated way.  
This was built to show how broadly one can use selenium. I wouldn't recommend using this, running a bot to book tee times is rather unethical if the demand is high at your local course. ⛳️❤️  
However, it makes for a great case study!  
You'll have to adapt the elements to be selected based on your golf course's website structure.

If you're new to Selenium this is a great video to start with -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7VZsCCnptM 

## Requirements

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install selenium and schedule.

```bash
pip install selenium schedule
```
